# SEM-3-OOPM-MINI-PROJECT-DIARY
A Desktop diary is an application which will help its users to organize their schedule, plan important meetings etc. 
Organizing your tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable. 
Seeing a clear outline of your completed and uncompleted tasks will help you feel organized and stay mentally focused.
Keeping a diary is important for some people, for many different reasons.
Traditionally, people would just write their thoughts in a small book, and then store it away in a safe place.
Diary app allows people to keep diaries on a computer.
Some like to jot down their personal experiences or thoughts.
By referring to them later, they may find help in analyzing their own feelings or emotions, thus finding help in their quest for self-improvement.
Some just may want to preserve their experiences and thoughts for posterity.
The primary goal of this project is to develop a good and easy to use software to overcome the existing problem caused by a manual system.
